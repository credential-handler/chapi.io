The CHAPI protocol allows your digital wallet to receive Verifiable Credentails from an independent third-party issuer - or present Verifiable Credentials to an independent third-party verifier - in a way that establishes trust and preserves privacy.
## CHAPI is for open for _everyone_
CHAPI is an open protocol designed to solve the "NASCAR Problem" - too often, users are presented with a fixed set of options for authentication with third-party sites.  The CHAPI protocol provides mediation between any CHAPI-enabled web application and third party site.  Just register your web app with your browser, and off you go!

Both [CHAPI](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/) and [Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) are results of open collaboration through World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).  You can find more information and join the discussion at the [W3C Credentials Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/).

## How does CHAPI work?
A _Credential Handler_ is an event handler for credential request and storage events.  Web app developers can use CHAPI to provide their users with Credential Handlers that run in the browser.  These Credential Hanlders can respond when users visit other websites that present, request, or store Verifiable Credentials.
