<p>The Credential Handler API (CHAPI) was originally described in a draft report for the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/">W3C Credentials Community Group</a>. It is being developed now as a ready-to-use API, libraries, and as integration documentation. This work supports the W3G CCG's mission to explore the technologies and use cases involving <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#dfn-verifiable-credential">Verifiable Credentials</a>.</p>
<h2 id="verifiable-credentials" tabindex="-1">Verifiable Credentials</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#dfn-verifiable-credential">Verifiable Credential</a> is a set of digital <em>claims</em> stated by an <em>issuer</em> about a <em>subject</em>.  The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials Data Model</a> recommendads a standard digital format for Verifiable Credentials on the Web - so that digital credentials can be easily issued, presented, and verified by anyone - while preserving the privacy of the parties involved.</p>
<p>A wide variety of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-use-cases/">Verifiable Credentials Use Cases</a> are emerging, as users and organizations move more of their everday activities online.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From educational records to payment account access, the next generation of web applications will authorize entities to perform actions based on rich sets of credentials issued by trusted parties. Human- and machine-mediated decisions about job applications, account access, collaboration, and professional development will depend on filtering and analyzing growing amounts of data. It is essential that data be verifiable.</p>
<p>Standardization of digital claim technologies makes it possible for many stakeholders to issue, earn, and trust these essential records about their counterparties, without being locked into proprietary platforms.</p>
<p><cite>from <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-use-cases/#importance-of-this-work">Verifiable Credentials Use Cases</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="establishing-trusted-communication" tabindex="-1">Establishing Trusted Communication</h2>
<p>The diversity of Verifiable Credentials applications means that users will be presented with Verifiable Credentials from many different issuers.  Users may be asked to present Verifiable Credentials by any third-party website.</p>
<p>How can we empower users to safely make these transactions?  CHAPI defines a method for users to designate trusted Web applications as <em>handlers</em> for credential requests and credential storage.  When the user visits a website that asks to present or requests Verifiable Credentials, the user is informed and consents to the transaction, and the designated <em>handler</em> responds to the request.</p>
<p>CHAPI can be implemented now by any third-party Web application - so users are not limited in their choices for software services that work with Verifiable Credentials.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/">Credentials Community Group</a> is a free and open forum for Web developers and stakeholders to connect and develop input for the next generation of Web standards.
