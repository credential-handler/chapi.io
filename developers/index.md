# Credential Handler API Developer Documentation

The Credential Handler API (CHAPI) enables integration with Issuers, Verifiers,
and Wallets as defined in the [Verifiable Credentials Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) specification.

## [Issuers](/developers/issuers/)
a role an entity can perform by asserting claims about one or more subjects, creating a verifiable credential from these claims, and transmitting the verifiable credential to a holder.

## [Verifiers](/developers/verifiers/)
a role an entity performs by receiving one or more verifiable credentials, optionally inside a verifiable presentation for processing. Other specifications might refer to this concept as a relying party.

## [Wallets](/developers/wallets/)
a program, such as a storage vault or personal verifiable credential wallet, that stores and protects access to holders' verifiable credentials.
