- **Example Code**: the [chapi-demo-wallet](https://github.com/credential-handler/chapi-demo-wallet) contains a full example implementation and is referenced throughout this guide.
- **Polyfill Library**: The [credential-handler-polyfill](https://github.com/credential-handler/credential-handler-polyfill) library provides the needed `CredentialHandler` API within the browser.
- **Helper Library**: The [web-credential-handler](https://github.com/credential-handler/web-credential-handler) library provides helper functions for CHAPI integration in your code.


## Native Wallet Registration

All Wallets need to be registered with the browser as a Credential Handler in order to store or retrieve Verifiable Credentials (VCs) on the Web.

To enable a native mobile wallet to receive VCs via CHAPI, your application will need to be configured to receive deep links from the mobile OS.

Deep links, also known as app links, cause a user's Web browser to open a native application and pass any URL to it when particular links are followed. This enables the user's Web browser to open a native mobile wallet from the CHAPI wallet selection menu and pass the CHAPI request to it. See appropriate deep link documentation for [Android](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/deep-linking) or [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/allowing-apps-and-websites-to-link-to-your-content?language=objc).

Consequently, you will be required by the mobile OS to host the appropriate operating system specific files on a Web server.

In addition, to enable CHAPI registration, your Web server will also need to host a `manifest.json` file as well as a registration page that allows the user to register your wallet with CHAPI within their mobile Web browser.

### 1. Add a `credential_handler` to the server's `manifest.json`

In order to register as a Credential Handler, your registration page's server must serve a `manifest.json` file from its root path (`/manifest.json`). This endpoint must be CORS-enabled which can be done by adding the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` header to responses for that URL.

Now, add the following `credential_handler` object with the appropriate `acceptedProtocols` your wallet can handle:

```json
{
  "credential_handler": {
    "url": "/switchboard",
    "enabledTypes": ["VerifiablePresentation"],
    "acceptedInput": "url",
    "acceptedProtocols": [
      "OID4VCI",
      "OID4VP",
      "vcapi"
    ]
  }
}
```

The `url` property must be the entry point for your mobile wallet so it must be a deep link that will open the application. Details about the event that initiates the opening of this URL will be relayed via query parameters appended to it.

The `"acceptedInput": "url"` line tells CHAPI that the wallet should receive data via opening the URL and providing query parameters rather than browser sent events typically used with Web wallets.

### 2. Allow your users to register their wallet as a Credential Handler with the browser polyfill

To register with CHAPI, your user must trigger the registration of your wallet as a Credential Handler within their browser. This must be initiated by user interaction, so you cannot automatically register without the user clicking or tapping a button or link.

We will load two libraries into the Wallet code to enable the registration:
- **Polyfill Library**: The [credential-handler-polyfill](https://github.com/credential-handler/credential-handler-polyfill) library provides the needed `CredentialHandler` API within the browser.
- **Helper Library**: The [web-credential-handler](https://github.com/credential-handler/web-credential-handler) library provides helper functions for CHAPI integration in your code.

You can add these libraries via `<script>` tags and watch a click event to
trigger the CHAPI registration and handler installation:

```html
<button id="installHandlerButton">Register Wallet</button>

<script src="https://unpkg.com/credential-handler-polyfill@3/dist/credential-handler-polyfill.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/web-credential-handler@2/dist/web-credential-handler.min.js"></script>

<script>
  document.getElementById('installHandlerButton').addEventListener('click', async function() {
    try {
      await credentialHandlerPolyfill.loadOnce();
      await WebCredentialHandler.installHandler();
      console.log('Handler Installed Successfully!');
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error installing handler: ' + error.message);
    }
  });
</script>
```

### 3. Link users to the registration page from your application

Your mobile application should include a link to your registration page. That link should open the device's default browser and allow them to register the wallet as a Credential Handler.

Once done, your Wallet should now be enabled to handle various credential related requests from across the Web.

## Verifiable Credential Storage

Now that your native wallet has been registered with CHAPI, it can receive requests to store credentials at the URL stated in the `credential_handler.url` of the `manifest.json` above.

CHAPI will use the endpoint declared (`/switchboard` in the example above) when it provides links to available wallets in the user's browser:

![Choose a wallet modal presenting all preregistered wallet systems which can be clicked on to proceed to store the credentials there.](/images/VeresCHAPIaccept.png)

The user will click the provided link to select your wallet from the list.
That link will contain a `request` query parameter with a URL encoded JSON object containing the following properties:

- `credentialRequestOrigin`: This will tell the wallet where the request originated
- `protocols`: This will include any available credential exchange protocols (for issuance and/or presentation). The wallet may retrieve the credential for storage from any of the available protocols.

Here is an example URL showing the `request` query parameter and its URL encoded value:

<pre><code style="white-space: normal;overflow: auto;word-break: break-all;">
https://wallet.example.com/switchboard?request=%7B%22credentialRequestOrigin%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fplayground.chapi.io%22%2C%22protocols%22%3A%7B%22OID4VCI%22%3A%22openid-credential-offer%3A%2F%2F%3Fcredential_offer%3D%257B%2522credential_issuer%2522%253A%2522https%253A%252F%252Fexample.exchanger.com%252Fexchangers%252Fz1A1GqykGBWKbwhFCDqFjMfnG%252Fexchanges%252Fz1A36rr6wEL25EEiikKvisVEC%2522%252C%2522credentials%2522%253A%255B%257B%2522format%2522%253A%2522ldp_vc%2522%252C%2522credential_definition%2522%253A%257B%2522%2540context%2522%253A%255B%2522https%253A%252F%252Fwww.w3.org%252F2018%252Fcredentials%252Fv1%2522%252C%2522https%253A%252F%252Fpurl.imsglobal.org%252Fspec%252Fob%252Fv3p0%252Fcontext.json%2522%255D%252C%2522type%2522%253A%255B%2522VerifiableCredential%2522%252C%2522OpenBadgeCredential%2522%255D%257D%257D%255D%252C%2522grants%2522%253A%257B%2522urn%253Aietf%253Aparams%253Aoauth%253Agrant-type%253Apre-authorized_code%2522%253A%257B%2522pre-authorized_code%2522%253A%25220065a8a0-069b-46f1-a857-4e1ce5047afd%2522%257D%257D%257D%22%2C%22vcapi%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fexchanger.example.com%2Fexchangers%2Fz1A1GqykGBWKbwhFCDqFjMfnG%2Fexchanges%2Fz19mxa763DAKX7diL51kBFecZ%22%7D%7D
</code></pre>

The `request` value is URL encoded. Its contents look like this when unencoded:

```json
{
  "credentialRequestOrigin": "https://playground.chapi.io",
  "protocols": {
    "vcapi": "https://exchanger.example.com/exchangers/z1A1GqykGBWKbwhFCDqFjMfnG/exchanges/z19mxa763DAKX7diL51kBFecZ",
    "OID4VCI": "openid-credential-offer://?credential_offer=%7B%22credential_issuer%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fexample.exchanger.com%2Fexchangers%2Fz1A1GqykGBWKbwhFCDqFjMfnG%2Fexchanges%2Fz1A36rr6wEL25EEiikKvisVEC%22%2C%22credentials%22%3A%5B%7B%22format%22%3A%22ldp_vc%22%2C%22credential_definition%22%3A%7B%22%40context%22%3A%5B%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2018%2Fcredentials%2Fv1%22%2C%22https%3A%2F%2Fpurl.imsglobal.org%2Fspec%2Fob%2Fv3p0%2Fcontext.json%22%5D%2C%22type%22%3A%5B%22VerifiableCredential%22%2C%22OpenBadgeCredential%22%5D%7D%7D%5D%2C%22grants%22%3A%7B%22urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Agrant-type%3Apre-authorized_code%22%3A%7B%22pre-authorized_code%22%3A%220065a8a0-069b-46f1-a857-4e1ce5047afd%22%7D%7D%7D"
  }
}
```

There are currently two possible protocols that Issuers may use with CHAPI in order to issue Verifiable Credentials to be stored in the user's digital wallet: `vcapi` and `OID4VCI`.

Depending on what you declared in your `acceptedProtocols` you may receive either or both as properties in the `protocols` object carried in the `request` query parameter. Your wallet's code (i.e. in `/switchboard`) should decide which protocol to use (or it may delegate this choice to advanced users) when multiple protocols are available.

### VC-API

The `vcapi` property will contain a URL the wallet can use to retrieve the issued credential(s).

To store one or more credentials via VC-API, the wallet first sends a `POST` request
to the URL (extracted from `protocols.vcapi` above) with an empty JSON object
(`{}`) in the body of the request to attempt to download the VC to be stored.

```http
POST /exchangers/z1A1GqykGBWKbwhFCDqFjMfnG/exchanges/z19mxa763DAKX7diL51kBFecZ
Host: exchanger.example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{}
```

The response to that request will be an object that may have a
`verifiablePresentation` object and / or a `verifiablePresentationRequest`
object. If a `verifiablePresentation` object is present, it will contain any
verifiable credentials that were issued. If a `verifiablePresentationRequest`
object is present, then there are further steps required in the exchange
such as DID Auth. The `verifiablePresentationRequest` object will describe
what is required to continue the exchange. When no
`verifiablePresentationRequest` object is present, the exchange is complete.

Below is a partial example response:

```json
{
  "verifiablePresentation": {
    "@context": [
      "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
      "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1",
      "https://w3id.org/security/suites/ed25519-2020/v1"
    ],
    "type": ["VerifiablePresentation"],
    "holder": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21",
    "verifiableCredential": [{
      "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
        "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1",
        "https://w3id.org/security/suites/ed25519-2020/v1"
      ],
      "id": "http://example.edu/credentials/3732",
      "type": [
        "VerifiableCredential",
        "UniversityDegreeCredential"
      ],
      ...
    }]
  }
}
```

More complete examples can be found in the
[Example Exchanges](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-api/#exchange-examples)
section of the [VC-API Specification](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-api/).

### OID4VCI

The `OID4VCI` property will be a URL that includes all of the required information to complete the issuance of the Verifiable Credential using the OID4VCI protocol.

Example OID4VCI protocol URL:
<pre><code style="white-space: normal;overflow: auto;word-break: break-all;">
openid-credential-offer://?credential_offer=%7B%22credential_issuer%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fexchanger.example.com%2Fexchangers%2Fz1A1GqykGBWKbwhFCDqFjMfnG%2Fexchanges%2Fz1A36rr6wEL25EEiikKvisVEC%22%2C%22credentials%22%3A%5B%7B%22format%22%3A%22ldp_vc%22%2C%22credential_definition%22%3A%7B%22%40context%22%3A%5B%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2018%2Fcredentials%2Fv1%22%2C%22https%3A%2F%2Fpurl.imsglobal.org%2Fspec%2Fob%2Fv3p0%2Fcontext.json%22%5D%2C%22type%22%3A%5B%22VerifiableCredential%22%2C%22OpenBadgeCredential%22%5D%7D%7D%5D%2C%22grants%22%3A%7B%22urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Agrant-type%3Apre-authorized_code%22%3A%7B%22pre-authorized_code%22%3A%220065a8a0-069b-46f1-a857-4e1ce5047afd%22%7D%7D%7D
</code></pre>

The `credential_offer` query parameter will be URL decoded resulting in a JSON
object containing the following details:

```json
{
  "credential_issuer": "https://exchanger.example.com/exchangers/z1A1GqykGBWKbwhFCDqFjMfnG/exchanges/z1A36rr6wEL25EEiikKvisVEC",
  "credentials": [
    {
      "format": "ldp_vc",
      "credential_definition": {
        "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1", "https://purl.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0/context.json"],
        "type": ["VerifiableCredential","OpenBadgeCredential"]
      }
    }
  ],
  "grants": {
    "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:pre-authorized_code": {
      "pre-authorized_code": "0065a8a0-069b-46f1-a857-4e1ce5047afd"
    }
  }
}
```

See the [OID4VCI Specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html) for more details on this protocol.

## Verifiable Credential Presentation

Browser side verification flows will open the CHAPI wallet selector in the user's
browser. If they select a native wallet, that URL will open the pre-registered
native wallet apps link (see above for how to register...).

That URL will to the Wallet's pre-registered domain--which will (thanks to the
magic of app links!) open in the user's wallet:
```
https://wallet.example.com/switchboard?request=
```

Depending on the protocols supported, the value of request will contain one
or more encoded JSON objects with nifty details...

...explain when this happens...maybe with mermaid chart?

### VC-API

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  # User visits Relying Party website and clicks something. Then this happens...

  participant site as OpenBadge Verifier Site
  participant chapi as User's Browser / CHAPI
  participant app as Native Wallet App
  participant exchanger as VC-API Exchanger

  site ->> exchanger: 1. creates an exchange within a workflow
  exchanger ->> site: 2. exchange URL/ID returned (in some JSON)
  site ->> chapi: 3. triggers CHAPI `get()` request w/blank VP + `protocols.vcapi` containing URL
  chapi ->> app: 4. triggers app URL to open app w/`?request=`
  app ->> exchanger: 5. uses VC-API  URL from `?request=` to send VPR
  exchanger ->> app: 6. returns VPR to wallet
  app ->> exchanger: 7. responds with VP
  exchanger ->> app: 9. sends success response to wallet
  # Webhooks here maybe?
  loop poll exchange status
    site ->> exchanger: exchange complete?
    exchanger ->> site: ...wait for it...
  end
```

The `vcapi` property within the object parsed above will contain a URL the wallet can use to handle that request.

To respond with zero or more credentials via a VC-API exchanger, the wallet MUST first send a `POST` request
to the URL (extracted from `protocols.vcapi` above) with an empty JSON object
(`{}`) in the body of the request to attempt to get a Verifiable Presentation
Request with the details about what the verifier wants.

```http
POST /exchangers/z1A1GqykGBWKbwhFCDqFjMfnG/exchanges/z19mxa763DAKX7diL51kBFecZ
Host: exchanger.example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{}
```

The response to that request will be a `verifiablePresentationRequest`
object. The `verifiablePresentationRequest` object will describe
what is required to continue the exchange.

Below is an example `verifiablePresentationRequest` containing a `QueryByExample`
query:

```json
{
  "verifiablePresentationRequest": {
    "query": [
      {
        "type": "QueryByExample",
        "credentialQuery": {
          "reason": "Please present your Verifiable Credential to complete the verification process.",
          "example": {
            "@context": [
              "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
              "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1"
            ],
            "type": [
              "UniversityDegreeCredential"
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The wallet should fulfill the request by sending another `POST` request to the
same exchange URL with a `verifiablePresentation` containing the user selected
credentials:

```json
{
  "verifiablePresentation": {
    "@context": [
      "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
      "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1",
      "https://w3id.org/security/suites/ed25519-2020/v1"
    ],
    "type": ["VerifiablePresentation"],
    "holder": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21",
    "verifiableCredential": [{
      "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
        "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1",
        "https://w3id.org/security/suites/ed25519-2020/v1"
      ],
      "id": "http://example.edu/credentials/3732",
      "type": [
        "VerifiableCredential",
        "UniversityDegreeCredential"
      ],
      ...
    }]
  }
}
```

When no `verifiablePresentationRequest` object is present, the exchange is
complete.

More complete examples can be found in the
[Example Exchanges](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-api/#exchange-examples)
section of the [VC-API Specification](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-api/).
