<p>The CHAPI protocol allows your digital wallet to receive Verifiable Credentials from an independent third-party issuer - or present Verifiable Credentials to an independent third-party verifier - in a way that establishes trust and preserves privacy.</p>

<p>CHAPI is an open protocol designed to solve the &quot;NASCAR Problem&quot; - too often, users are presented with a fixed set of options for authentication with third-party sites.  The CHAPI protocol provides mediation between any CHAPI-enabled web application and a third-party site.  Just register your web app with your browser, and off you go!</p>
<p>Both <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/">CHAPI</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> are results of open collaboration through World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).  You can find more information and join the discussion at the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/">W3C Credentials Community Group</a>.</p>
